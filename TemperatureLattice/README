Simulation of a 2D lattice where the temperature of the right and left lattice can be controlled and the
corresponding per particle energies can be visualized.

After a certain number of steps, the thermostat is switched off, and the system is allowed to equilibrate.

The script computes the per atom kinetic energy, bond energy, and total energy. 

Idea would be to sample the histogram of per particle energies and show how this starts as two peaks
and ends up as one peak when the system is equilibrated.

I get a segmentation fault when running the simulation, so need to check whether this also happens for
the standard LAMMPS version.
