#
#  2D model of liquid crystals.
# 
#  Liquid crystals are modelled as rods of 8 beads.
#  The initial conformation is nematic along the y axis
#
#  An extermal force is applied to the two ends of the rods to align it
#  This a trick because we simulate polar molecules with different heads and tails,
#  But this should be done with a proper external force that couple to the
#  director of the liquid crystals.
#
#  Area of the molecule is calculated based on 8 beads with bonds of length 0.75
#  and diameter of a bead = 1 from the soft interaction potential.
#
#  Due to the soft interactions, the effective radius is a bit smaller than this.
#

#
#  Number of molecules, try 50, 100, 200
