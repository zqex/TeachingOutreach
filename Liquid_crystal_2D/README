LAMMPS Simulation of a 2D model of liquid crystals. LCs are modelled as rods of 5 or 8 beads.

The interactions between the rods are purely repulsive U(r) = A cos(pi r/(2Rc))  potential, which is numerically well behaved.

I would expect the resulting system to be a lyotropic rather than a thermotropic liquid crystal due to purely repulsive interactions,
hence Onsager theory would be a better match than Maier-Saupe. However, there will be corrections due to 2D and soft interactions.

Simulations shows isotropic phases, nematic order, and also smectic order at high densities.
 
Lammps can not couple field to the director of the molecules, so to emulate the effect of an external alignment field,
I pull on the head and tail of the molecules (yes they are polar) with forces pointing along +x and -x, which aligns
the molecules.
