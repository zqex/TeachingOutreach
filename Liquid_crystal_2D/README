LAMMPS Simulation of a 2D model of liquid crystals. LCs are modelled as rods of 5 beads.

This does currently not work? Atleast I have not seen clear global nematic order, the relaxation times may be long or the potentials
may require tuning and tweaking.

I tried soft interactions between beads, which are purely repulsive U(r) = A cos(pi r/(2Rc))  potential, which is numerically well behaved.
Hard rods are described by Onsager theory, and should show nematic order at high densities. I tried 100,200,300,400 molecules, in the high
density systems rods pack nematically, but no global nematic order appers. Relaxation times may be too long for such a short simulation.

Then I thought perhaps alignment is inceased if there is an attrative interaction along the rods corresponding to the logic of
Mayer-Saupe theory. Lennard-Jones does that, but is not numerically well behaved due to strong repulsion at short distances. Hence I thought
of one of the soft core versions of LJ that LAMMPS has implemented.

This does not really work either, rods appears to pack parallel and it does not crash. But parameters of the potential has to be tuned if this
should produce global nematic order during a short simulation.

I thought of cheating. We could change the type of the first and last beads of the rods, and apply two external forces in opposite directions
to align the molecules. But it would always align in the same direction, which is also annoying..
